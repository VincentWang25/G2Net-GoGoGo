# Reproduce 1D Model Result

Below you can find a outline of how to reproduce our 1D Model solution for the G2Net-Gravitational-Wave-Detection competition. All shell commands used in each step are run from current directory


## DATA SETUP 
(3 steps To be combined!)
1. If there is no `data` folder in the parent folder, please 
   1. download it from the google drive (TBA link)
   2. put it inside parent folder
   3. rename the folder as `data` folder
1. Download kaggle competition data (assumes the [Kaggle API](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api) is installed)
   1. `cd ../data/`
   2. `kaggle competitions download -c g2net-gravitational-wave-detection`
   3. `unzip -q g2net-gravitational-wave-detection`
2. Generate whiten wave from competition data
   1. run notebook `1D_Model/notebooks/generate_whiten_wave.ipynb)`

## TRAINING AND INFERENCE. 

1. To train a single model using a config listed config.py, run `python train.py --model_config <config_name>`
2. To perform inference on a single model, run `python infer.py --model_config <config_name> --gen_oof 1 --gen_test 1`

3. To train all models and reproduce the result ( need to be deleted or combined with MODEL BUILD)
   2. reproduce models:`./reproduce_train.sh`  
   3. reproduce predictions: `./reproduce_infer_test.sh`

## MODEL BUILD: There are three options to reproduce the solution.

1) very fast prediction: run `notebook/stacking.ipynb`
    1. uses precomputed predictions
    2. runs in 2 hours (on hardware similar to ours)
2) ordinary prediction: run `reproduce_infer_test.sh`

    1) uses pretrained models
    2) expect this to run for 6 hours

1. retrain models: run `python reproduce_train.sh`
   1. trains all models from scratch
   2. If we want to use ensemble, we need to run `python reproduce_infer_oof_test.sh`. Then we need to change the directory inside `notebook/stacking.ipynb` correspondingly to point to each oof prediction and submission file.
   3. expect this to run about a week


## HARDWARE: (The following specs were used to create the original solution)

1 x NVIDIA Tesla A100 or 2 x NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti.
